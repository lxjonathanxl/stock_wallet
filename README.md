## Introduction

This project is divided into five main parts:

1. **Wallet**:
   - Manages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
   - Perform user registration, authorization, and updates.
   - Stores user data, including owned stocks and transaction history, in a MySQL database.
   - Handles stock transactions by connecting to either an outsourced API or the local MockStockApi to gather stock quotes.
   - Generates a transaction history during each transaction, saving it to the database and sending it to a Kafka topic.
   - On kafka message consumption it connects to the NotificationApi to asynchronously send transaction information to the user's email, ensuring the notification process does not interfere with the transaction flow.

2. **MockStockApi**:
   - Generates mock stock data with random information given a symbol.
   - Stores the generated stock data in a MongoDB database.
   - Provides stock information upon request.
   - Secures the stock creation port by connecting to AuthorizationServerMockStock, which uses OAuth 2 with an authorization code flow.

3. **NotificationApi**:
   - Sends an email to the user with transaction details based on the provided transaction information.

4. **Docker**:
   - Each module has a Dockerfile, which is used by `compose.yaml` to create a network of interdependent services.

5. **CI/CD Workflow**:
   - Utilizes GitHub Actions to create a workflow triggered on every push to the main branch.
   - Builds the container, runs unit and integration tests, and, upon passing tests, deploys to an Azure virtual machine.

## Components

1. [wallet](/wallet) Spring MVC application, Created with Spring security, Kafka for messaging, Testcontainers for testing environments, Thymeleaf for server-side rendering, and JPA for database interactions.
2. [apiMockStocks](/apiMockStocks) Spring RestApi, created with Spring security, includes dependencies for MongoDB integration, security with OAuth2, and comprehensive testing support using Testcontainers and JUnit.
3. [notificationApi](/notificationApi) Spring RestApi, created with email support with Spring Mail, validation, and testing using Spring Boot Starter Test.

Take a look at the components diagram that describes their interactions.
